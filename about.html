        The idea for Togather was born at the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. We saw an article on the Dutch news where a family had kept a diary for their relative in the ICU and gave this to her when she was discharged from the hospital. They wrote down what happened to her while she was in the ICU, but also happened in the world outside, weather forecasts, some news items, things the family had done. We thought this was really nice, and we wanted to make this available for people going through similar experiences. As we realize that going through these trying times, where families and friends get separated, it can leave you feel powerless. We hope that through getting together and capturing your life together as a group provides a space to get strength from each other and find some light. A space where even though live going on seems weird, you can make shared memories together, with your loved one at the centre of it all. We want to have your back to help your community gather in stories when being together is not possible.

    <div class="title about">Your Privacy</div>
    <div class="about__text-box">
        To ensure your privacy and not risk your private conversations on WhatsApp falling in the hands of anyone other than who you choose to share it with, we have taken the needed precautions. Most importantly, Togather is a webpage that after loading on your device no longer needs connection to the internet. Your device only needs an internet connection to share topics and messages from the Togather website to your WhatsApp group conversation.

        At the end of assembling your diary you will be asked to share some feedback with us. This is because we are a team of researchers, which you can read two sections down, that would like to hear what your experiences are with Togather. This is completely voluntary and in no way affects your access to or usage of the Togather website. We are simply curious. To support this feedback and get some insight into how people use together we log which topics are shared. But thatâ€™s it, we do not register any user data, nothing that can trace back to anyone. To give you an idea of what data we capture we have created an example of a log for one day, click here to see it.

    <div class="title about">The people behind Togather</div>
    <div class="about__text-box"> 
        We are a team of design researchers from Newcastle University and Northumbria University based in Newcastle Upon-Tyne in the United Kingdom. We are part of the research project called Enabling Ongoingness (www.enablingongoingness.com) which explores how we can give new meaning to relationships in the context of end-of life and bereavement. A large part of this is exploring how people curate the essence of a relationship in media, stories, objects and rituals in everyday life. During the Covid-19 pandemic we were faced with a new worldwide shared experience of fear of loss and grief. It is unlike anything anyone in our team had experienced before. This has changed your, and our, lives in many ways. Through Togather we hope that we can help you capture your community bonds in a time where this is not as easy as it was before. If you have any experiences with Togather that you would like to share with us do not hesitate to reach out. You can either send us a message over e-mail (kyle.montague@northumbria.ac.uk) or fill out our feedback form
